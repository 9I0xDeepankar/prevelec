### Enhancements available to do

(difficulty mentioned out of 5 and graded relatively) <br />

- [ ] In dashboard overall rank, rename the heading as leaderboard and pull the list of users from the database. use random values generated by the random function for the number of units used. ![leaderboard image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59884618/138979430-d19423be-8683-4296-a387-a210199c89f2.png)

<!-- <img src="" height="200px" /> -->
<!-- <br/> -->

- [ ] Add a form page to upload the units used per month in an year. It should have the fields: 'units used' (text) , 'month' (drop down). Upon submitting, the data needs to be persisted to database connected along with a **reference field** of userId. (This PR will be counted as 2 PRs). <br />
- [ ] Add option to add images in compose page. Make sure the image is visible along with title and post once published in the blog page. (will be counted as 2 PRs) <br />
- [ ] The components in dashboard are shifted to left align. Fix it to make it center aligned. <br /><br /><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59884618/138979928-04320506-17bd-465b-8f5b-d4f5bb52c8a3.png" height="200px" />
- [ ] Remake the landing page - it should have the following things (Each of the following count as a separate PR). <br />
  - [ ] use particle js to make a jumbotron with heading as PREVELEC and a short description of the website (20-30 words from lorem ipsum).
  - [ ] List of contributors to the project (use format as shown below) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59884618/138980293-14aef481-aac5-4d65-8c02-ec969e2130cb.png)
  - [ ] Nav bar should have only signin option if user is not signed in.
